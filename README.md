#  Automate callbacks using always-running campaigns and data actions Blueprint

> View the full [Automated Callback Blueprint article](https://developer.mypurecloud.com/blueprints/automated-callback-blueprint/) on the Genesys Cloud Developer Center.

This Genesys Cloud Blueprint explains how to configure automated callbacks by using data actions to add numbers to an agentless always-running outbound dialing campaign on Genesys Cloud. This enables a user who called at a time when no agents were available to receive a callback after a designated time. The callback is based on parameters configured in an Architect flow. If desired, you can have the user confirm that they still need help, or send the call directly to an agent.
